## Photo of the day
image photos/1933earthquake.jpeg
 caption In 1933 an evening earthquake shook Long Beach, resulting in the deaths of 52 Long Beach residents and destroying 70 schools. Within one month the Field Act was passed by the California State Legislature which put the DSA in charge of public school architecture. In the following 90 years no school in California has collapsed or had a fatality from a seismic event.
